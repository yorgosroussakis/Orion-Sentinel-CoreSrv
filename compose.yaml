# Orion-Sentinel-CoreSrv - Root Compose File
# Dell deployment with Traefik reverse proxy
#
# Usage:
#   Use orionctl to manage stacks:
#     ./scripts/orionctl up ingress
#     ./scripts/orionctl up observability
#     ./scripts/orionctl up home
#     ./scripts/orionctl up apps
#     ./scripts/orionctl up portal
#
#   Or start all at once:
#     ./scripts/orionctl up all
#
# Documentation: See README.md for full setup instructions

# This file defines shared networks used by all stacks
# Individual stacks are in stacks/<name>/stack.yaml

# Include all stack files (Docker Compose v2.20+)
