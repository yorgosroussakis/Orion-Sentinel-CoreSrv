## Differences from Upstream

While heavily inspired by the upstream projects, `orion-dell-hub` differs in several key ways:

### Architectural Differences

1. **3-Node Architecture:**
   - Orion uses a dedicated Pi for DNS (Pi-hole + Unbound)
   - Upstream repos include DNS services (AdGuard Home)
   - We exclude DNS services to avoid conflicts

2. **Network Segmentation:**
   - Named networks with `orion_` prefix for clarity
   - Additional monitoring network for telemetry isolation
   - Explicit network architecture documentation

3. **Multi-Pi Integration:**
   - Designed to work alongside Pi DNS and Pi NetSec nodes
   - Monitoring stack scrapes metrics from multiple Pis
   - Architecture documentation includes all 3 nodes

### Service Differences

1. **Monitoring Stack:**
   - Full Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Promtail stack
   - Uptime Kuma for cross-node monitoring
   - Dashboards for multi-node visibility

2. **Opinionated Defaults:**
   - ProtonVPN as default VPN provider
   - Europe/Amsterdam as default timezone
   - Explicit `/srv/orion` directory structure

3. **Security Posture:**
   - All services behind Authelia by default
   - Explicit zero-trust security stance
   - 2FA recommended for all administrative access

### Documentation Differences

1. **Multi-Node Focus:**
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` documents entire 3-node system
   - Setup guides reference Pi DNS for DNS resolution
   - Monitoring guides expect cross-node telemetry

2. **Upstream Sync Process:**
   - `UPSTREAM-SYNC.md` provides explicit sync workflow
   - Not a fork, so manual sync process documented
   - Sync log table for tracking changes over time
