# Mealie Recipe Sync - Settings Configuration
# General settings for the recipe sync service

# Mealie API connection (can be overridden by environment variables)
mealie_url: http://mealie:9000
# API token should be set via MEALIE_API_TOKEN environment variable

# Sync behavior
max_new_recipes_per_run: 20  # Maximum recipes to import in a single sync
                             # Prevents overwhelming Mealie or source sites
                             # Can be overridden by MAX_NEW_RECIPES_PER_RUN env var

# Sync interval is set via SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES environment variable
# Default: 360 minutes (6 hours)
# Recommended ranges:
#   - 360-1440 (6-24 hours) for RSS feeds
#   - 10080 (weekly) for curated URL lists
#   - 1440-4320 (1-3 days) for sitemaps

# Notes:
# - The sync runs continuously in a loop
# - Each source's max_entries/max_pages setting controls batch size
# - Already-imported recipes are automatically skipped
# - Failed imports are logged but don't stop the sync process
