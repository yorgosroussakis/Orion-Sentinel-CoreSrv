# Tips for adding your own sources:
#
# RSS Feeds:
#   - Most recipe blogs have RSS feeds (usually /feed/ or /rss/)
#   - Check the website footer or look for RSS icons
#   - Test feeds with a feed reader first
#
# URL Lists:
#   - Best for specific recipes you want to save
#   - Great for organizing themed collections
#   - URLs must be from sites Mealie can scrape
#
# Sitemaps:
#   - Use sparingly to avoid overwhelming your Mealie instance
#   - Always use allowlist to filter relevant recipes
#   - Set reasonable max_pages limit
#   - Test with small limits first
